# <Note-Taker>

## Description

This note taker project was focused on having a better understanding of express.js. It helped also utilize past skills learnt such as fs write and read as well as understanding how to display and read parsed and non-parsed objects. It helped refine my understanding of how the back end interacts with the front end, especially when learning take input, display it and and also retrieve or delete it.
