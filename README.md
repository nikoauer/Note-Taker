# <Note-Taker>

## Description

This note-taker project was focused on having a better understanding of express.js. It also helped utilize past skills learnt such as fs write and read and understand how to display and read parsed and non-parsed objects. It helped refine my understanding of how the back end interacts with the front end, especially when learning to take input, display it and also retrieve or delete it.
